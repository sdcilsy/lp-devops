## **Certifications you might want to look into**

There are several Linux certifications and you can choose to study for any of them really, but a lot of them cover WAY more than what you need to know for a solid foundation and are more focused on Linux administration.

- [LPI essentials](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/linux-essentials-overview)
- [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training-and-certification)
- [Linux Foundation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification-catalog/)
- [Oracle](https://education.oracle.com/oracle-certification-path/pFamily_358)
- [LPI](https://www.lpi.org/)
- [Comptia Linux+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/linux)

There are also TONS of networking certifications out there, and similar to the Linux ones, they are more focused on giving you a lot of knowledge so you can become a networking engineer/specialist, again at an introductory level, it's a little overkill. If you did want to get one, take a look at the [Cisco certifications](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications.html) which are pretty much industry standard and/or [Comptia Network+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network)

At the end of the day, if you want to take them, go for it :)
